00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
themselves are very important, one is the region and other is that availability so, right.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Regions that, okay I will show you guys the thing as well, but regions means that there

00:16.000 --> 00:28.000
are geographical dispersed locations where AWS, AWS, SS, their data centrally, right.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
So, apparently there are 37 regions to operate, right.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
Then what happened that for each region, for example I will say this is the map of the world, right.

00:42.000 --> 00:52.000
And this map shows that there are 37 regions, for example this one I showed you, now I will just

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
tell you about it. So, there are 37 regions. So, for each region, for each region which

00:59.000 --> 01:09.000
is geographically dispersed, there are, this is one region. So, for one region, there are

01:09.000 --> 01:26.000
minimum three availability maps, right. So, for each region, there are the various regions

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
known as these, the various regions have the data sellers and these ways these are interacting

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
with each other, right. So, what is happening there are part of it means to some kind of

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
disaster happen, they can migrate their resources and you must know things, other available

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
regions, these are within their region. Right. So, in high availability, if you are in this

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
region and you can use this availability one, maybe you can, if you are making a delay,

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
you can change your availability as well, as well with this region. Right. So, these are

02:01.000 --> 02:17.000
just regions, I have just the data sellers. So, each region has minimum of three availability,

02:17.000 --> 02:28.000
right. Then comes the local zone, as I was discussing with you about this CDN that there

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
should be some kind of thing as you see, right. So, what is happening that there in some

02:34.000 --> 02:43.000
quality local zone, these same concept here, concept of the delay, to make you get that

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
delay, what is happening the regions have the local zones and these local zones are closer

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
to the users and they can get their data without any delay. So, the data cash it here and

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
then the users can access these resources, right. So, if you are looking to this type,

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
there are these are these regions available for the world, right. And for over application

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
for this type of piece, they show that you have to use this, not original, right, because

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
it is not very expensive. Please, they show that this often for the city, don't use that,

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
because if you are using a city, you will have to get more charges, okay.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
So, it is fine, I will show you.
